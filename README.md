This dashboard was developed for a leading global tire company to analyze and monitor product demand across its warehouse network in the United States. As a major player in the tire industry, the company relies on robust data visualization tools like this to ensure its warehouses operate efficiently, maintain optimal inventory levels, and adapt to changing market demands.

The dashboard provides a comprehensive view of key metrics, including total demand by quarter, year-over-year (YoY) percentage changes, and performance breakdowns by product, segment, and location. These insights allow the company to identify patterns and trends, ensuring a more strategic approach to inventory management and resource allocation. The geographic visualization offers an additional layer of analysis by highlighting demand concentrations across different locations, enabling operational optimization and targeted strategies to address regional variances.

By tracking the top-performing products and analyzing declining demand segments, the company can fine-tune its marketing, production, and distribution efforts. The ability to correlate demand data with warehouse performance ensures that resources are allocated effectively, helping the company maintain its competitive edge in a dynamic market.

This dashboard is a valuable tool for aligning the companyâ€™s operations with its business goals, ensuring it continues to meet customer expectations while optimizing efficiency across its supply chain.
